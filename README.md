Hello! This project is my own personal portfolio website. This website contains a navigation bar, a hero section giving a description of myself, skills and experience sections, 
and a projects section containing previous projects that I have worked on, as well as demo and GitHub options. 
There is also a contact section included containing my email and LinkedIn and such. When it comes to the actual programming, 
I began by using React to create a backend for me, allowing me to use that blank canvas to create the front end and other functional parts of the wesbite. 
I started by creating files for colour schemes and an index file, for use of an app template code that I created to lessen the repition of rewriting it. 
After that, I created the app file in order to have the main section so that I could add other sections onto it. 
I then created the navbar section, complete with a dropdown list that allows the user to move to other sections of the webpage. 
After that, I created a hero section with a picture and description of myself. I made CSS and JavaScript files for each section that I created classes for to 
apply to each part of the section for colour, placement, size, and shape specifications, as well as animations and other things like that. 
After creating the hero section, I created skills and experience sections, of which I added pictures and descriptions of my skills. 
After that, I created the projects section which had cards for each project, giving it a description and demo/GitHub link. 
Finally, I created the contact section, giving the user different methods of contacting me. I also used JavaScript to create an email link that 
allows the user to directly write me an email instead of having to go to their own email and manually write my email. To conclude, 
the website had many parts and specifications, which I made to my own liking. I plan to use this website to further host future projects. 
The website is currently hosted on Netlify, however I plan to buy my own domain and host this website there. Thank you for taking the time to read this description of my website!
